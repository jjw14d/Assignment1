(b) 8 commits have been made. Check with the 'shortlog' command.

(c) September 27. Found using github UI.

(d) irlabuser was the author for both merges.

(e) Changes are isolated from the main body of code, so they can be
committed without overwriting the master. This way, team members
can view, edit, and discuss solutions for a temporary module without
permanently overwriting the master.

(f) 'log' gives verbose information on previous commits and repository
history, while status outputs information pertaining to the state of the present
working directory in comparison to the remote repository.

(g) git log -p Weapon.h

(h) git log grep=file

(i)
	I.) Inheritance is a mechanism by which one class, called the child of
	another class, can 'inherit' properties of the latter, such as
	functions and member variables, while also having properties unique
	to itself.
	
	II.) Polymorphism refers to the technique of desinging
	software such that it will work the same regardless of the type of
	its input. Templated classes and functions in C++ are one example.
	
	III.) Encapsulated software is that which puts related data elements
	that frequently interact inside a single object, by which the
	user may perform the tasks carried out by its contents without
	undesrstanding their exact implementation.
